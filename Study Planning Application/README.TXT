AUTHORS: Skyler Young 

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Once the interface is started, using the program is very simple.
There is a place at the top of the program where a user can type in a title for
the project or test they are currently working on. The left button will add a new
task, while the right button clears the interface. 

When you create a new task, you have the ability to name it, and assign it a ranking of 
confidence from 0 to 4. From your own self-confidence, your predicted score will be 
calculated and displayed on the panel above.

There is also a menu bar that accomplishes all of these functions.
